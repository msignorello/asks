# What Is ASKS #
"ASKS" is aiming to be a comprehensive system for tracking and maintaining archival history for topscores, players and multimedia for home and commercial arcades or gamerooms.

ASKS plans to incorporate administrator access controls for easy management of players and games. Player access for constant updates and seeing current tracking of their positions on games.

Email Notifications for high scores and gameroom / arcade announcements

Multiple levels of reporting based on collected data. EX: Topscores per game, top 3 scores per game, top players who achieve high scores consistently, etc.

Support for custom themes and gameroom designs.

Based on PHP and MySQL ASKS is striving to be a flexible and modular system to allow for future components to be added with ease.
